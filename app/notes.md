\*\*\* currently working on About section

\*\* useStateContext hook works as a event/subscriber system allowing me to utilize the scroll line to enable/disable sections

1. Landing Page - is to be the home of the animation currently sitting on SVGator. Not entirely sure it will fit perfectly so its still an optional page.

2. Home Section

- Includes the Hero section which is just my name SVG
- Scroll Line works but needs adjustments or refactor. The line needs to be visible while scrolling
- Scroll Content needs serious attention. The SVG morph anims works but take too long to load so need to simplify the svgs or I might just need to fix the code?
- Scroll Content currently has a single SVG morph set created. Still need 3 more sets
  \*\* After animation is included then i need to add a fade in for something like "Hi, I'm" above my name.
