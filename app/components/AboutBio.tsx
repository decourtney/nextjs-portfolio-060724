        I'm a software developer passionate about creating
        engaging user experiences and visually appealing designs. With a rich
        history in IT and a solid foundation in web development, I'm always
        seeking new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

            I developed a love for technology at a young age when we got our
            first family PC â€” Pentium 286 running Windows 2.1. My love of coding
            began with the excitement of piecing together HTML to create my
            first GeoCities fansite (Diablo 1, of course).

            Then I joined the US Marine Corps and fell into cybersecurity. I've
            remained in this field but have always kept programming within reach
            through traditional college courses, online learning, and writing
            automation scripts. To advance my understanding of programming
            concepts, I dove deep into the Unity3D game engine, producing
            numerous small projects for my kids. I even published a Flappy Bird
            clone to experience the full start-to-publish process. Additionally,
            I enjoy being artistic, so I dabble in 3D modeling, texturing, and
            animation.

            As I continue to evolve as a developer, I'm excited to take on new
            challenges and collaborate with like-minded individuals who are
            equally passionate about technology. Whether it's building
            innovative web applications, exploring new programming paradigms, or
            creating captivating digital experiences, I'm driven by the endless
            possibilities that coding offers. I'm eager to bring my unique blend
            of skills and experiences to new projects and make a meaningful
            impact.
