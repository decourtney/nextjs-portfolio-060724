      "The objective was to design a simple, clean portfolio using HTML and CSS to effectively showcase my projects. I initially envisioned a scrolling parallax effect featuring a stream of 1's and 0's in the background, reminiscent of the Matrix. However, due to my limited experience at the time, achieving this effect proved challenging. As a result, I opted for a horizontal looping background within a vertical parallax effect, which still captured the dynamic feel I was aiming for."

      "This project marked my first venture after mastering the basics of React, and it quickly proved to be a formidable challenge. Initially, the idea sparked while I was experimenting with animating multiple images in the viewport. My vision was to create a site entirely out of images that would evoke the illusion of a 3D object, rich in perspective and depth.",
      "While HTML attributes made it relatively simple to establish the sense of depth I was aiming for, bringing these \"3D\" elements to life through animation was a daunting task. Thankfully, Framer Motion integrated seamlessly, simplifying the process of creating smooth, dynamic animations, even during React dismounts.",
      "The final product met my expectations, though not without its trade-offs. As anticipated, the heavy reliance on large images did impact site performance, making it sluggish and rendering updates or modifications more cumbersome. Despite these challenges, I succeeded in my objective to craft an unconventional site with a distinctive look and feelâ€”reminiscent of an old, rusted machine."
